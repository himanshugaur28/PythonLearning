# Python Math

# Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module,
# that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

# Built-in Math Functions

# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

import math
x = min(3, 6, 2)
y = max(2, 5, 3)

print(x)
print(y)


# The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:

x = abs(-7.25)
print(x)


# The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).

x = pow(2, 3)
print(x)


# The Math Module

# Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.
# To use it, you must import the math module:


# When you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module.
# The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number

x = math.sqrt(64)
print(x)


# The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer,
# and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result

x = math.ceil(1.4)
y = math.floor(1.4)

print(x)
print(y)


# The math.pi constant, returns the value of PI (3.14...):

x = math.pi

print(x)
